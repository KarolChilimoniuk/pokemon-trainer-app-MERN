### Introduction ‚è©
Hello World! I have a pleasure to present my MERN app. In this app you can check all pokemons, their stats, thier look etc. Furthermore, I added a login/register feature.
You can create a user account where you can add trainers from pokemon games you played and next, you can add caught pokemons to every trainer. Enjoy!

You don't have to register your account. You can use demo account to log in:
**e-mail:** *xyz@wp.pl*
**password:** *xyz*

**** Note: All my projects were recently migrated from Heroku to Render and it may take approximately 45-120 seconds to spin up the servers once loaded ****
